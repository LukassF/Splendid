## General info
Splendid is an app that is unomitably similar to Tik-Tok, and its core principles are in fact inspired by the concepts of the well-known app. However, it has several distinctive qualities, most of which are stylistic, that make it stand out from the competition. Here, responsiveness also has a significant impact on the user experience in an effort to make it as enjoyable and memorable as possible.

## Additional info
Splendid is my first large project and thus the scarcity of commits, since my journey with git and github has bagun shortly after completing this project.
Also the code organisation, altough unimpressive in this particular project, may serve as a base for comparison to my latest projects, and hence visualize my self improvements later on.
